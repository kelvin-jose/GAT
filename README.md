# GAT
PyTorch implementation of the paper Graph Attention Networks

### Overview
This repository contains a custom implementation of the Graph Attention Network (GAT) as described in the original research paper, applied to the Cora citation network dataset. The project demonstrates node classification using attention mechanisms in graph neural networks.

### Project Structure
* Cora EDA.ipynb: Exploratory Data Analysis notebook
* layer.py: Custom GAT layer implementation
* train.py: Training script for the GAT model
